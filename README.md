# Computational tools for protein analysis

Here you'll find four programs. They are

  1) ZnAtoms.py: given a PDB file, it identifies zinc (Zn) biding sites in the protein structure;
  2) find_site.py: given a Fasta file, it identifies which proteins contain Zn bind site. The binding sites considered here are the ones found in Human Transthyretin (see reference 1 in "Report_ZnAtoms");
  3) interfaces.py: given a PDB file, it identifies the contacts between the residues in two or more chains which create an interface;
  4) compare_interfaces.py: given a PDB file, it quantifies the contacts between residues in each interfaces of the structure.

All the files used in the reserch are available at "PDBs and Fastas" folder. Also there is a folder with some results and a PDF file with a report about the observed data in the structures with Zn.

OBS: UA and UB stands for asymetrical unit and biological unit, respectly.
